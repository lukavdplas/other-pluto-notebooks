# Other Pluto notebooks

I created the repository [pluto-notebooks](github.com/lukavdplas/pluto-notebooks) to share some notebooks that I thought might be interesting to other people. Since that repo actually sees daylight, I don't want to clutter it with every half-baked idea I think of. This repository is to keep some notebooks that I make as practice, or vague ideas that I haven't worked out yet.
